# 🚦 Road Accident Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of road accidents based on various factors such as road type, vehicle type, weather conditions, and light conditions. It uses Machine Learning algorithms to analyze accident data and provides a user-friendly web interface for predictions.

## 📌 Features

- Predicts accident severity (High/Low).
- Uses **Random Forest**, **Decision Tree**, **SVM**, **KNN**, and **Naive Bayes** algorithms.
- Random Forest was selected as the best model based on accuracy.
- Web-based interface for user input and predictions.
- Model deployment using the **Pickle** library.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Web Development**: Flask, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Deployment**: Pickle, Flask
